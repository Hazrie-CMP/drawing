```

Using `yarn`

```bash
yarn add @excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw
```

## Usage

Once the library is installed, its ready to use.

```js
import { parseMermaidToExcalidraw } from "@excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw";
import { convertToExcalidrawElements}  from "@excalidraw/excalidraw"

try {
  const { elements, files } = await parseMermaid(diagramDefinition, {
    fontSize: DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE,
  });
  const excalidrawElements = convertToExcalidrawElements(elements);

  // Render elements and files on Excalidraw
} catch (e) {
  // Error handling
}
```

## Playground

:::info

 If you're clicking the "Render to Excalidraw" button on the same diagram multiple times, you may notice a slight change of elements stroke on the Excalidraw diagram. 
 This occurs as a result of the `randomness` featured in the libraries used by Excalidraw, specifically Rough.js.
