# FAQ

### Does this package support collaboration ?

No, Excalidraw package doesn't come with collaboration built in, since the implementation is specific to each host app. We expose APIs which you can use to communicate with Excalidraw which you can use to implement it. You can check our own implementation [here](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/excalidraw-app/index.tsx). Here is a [detailed answer](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/discussions/3879#discussioncomment-1110524) on how you can achieve the same.

### Turning off Aggresive Block Fingerprinting in Brave browser

Since when *Aggresive Block Fingerprinting* is turned on, the `measureText` API breaks which in turn breaks the Test Elements in your drawings. Here is more [info](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6336) on the same.

Hence we have added a *warning* when such situtation is encountered.

We strongly recomment turning it off. You can follow :point_down: steps on how to do so.

1. Open [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) in Brave and click on the `Sheild` button

2. Once opened, look for **Aggressively Block Fingerprinting**

3. Switch to **Block Fingerprinting**

4. Thats all. All text elements should be fixed now ðŸŽ‰

If disabling this setting doesn't fix the display of text elements, please consider opening an [issue](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/new) on our GitHub or join write to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/UexuTaE).
