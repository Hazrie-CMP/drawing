# Development

#### Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

#### Start the server

```bash
yarn start
```

[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) will open in your default browser.

The example is same as the [codesandbox example](https://ehlz3.csb.app/)

#### Create a test release

You can create a test release by posting the below comment in your pull request

```
@excalibot trigger release
```

Once the version is released `@excalibot` will post a comment with the release version.

#### Creating a production release

To release the next stable version follow the below steps

```
yarn prerelease version
```

You need to pass the `version` for which you want to create the release. This will make the changes needed before making the release like updating `package.json`, `changelog` and more.

The next step is to run the `release` script

```
yarn release
```

This will publish the package.

Right now there are two steps to create a production release but once this works fine these scripts will be combined and more automation will be done.
