### onChange

Every time component updates, this callback if passed will get triggered and has the below signature.

```js
(excalidrawElements, appState, files) => void;
```

1. `excalidrawElements`: Array of [excalidrawElements](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/element/types.ts#L114) in the scene.

2. `appState`: [AppState](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L95) of the scene.

3. `files`: The [BinaryFiles](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L64) which are added to the scene.

Here you can try saving the data to your backend or local storage for example.

### initialData

<pre>
&#123; elements?: <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/element/types.ts#L114">ExcalidrawElement[]</a>, appState?: <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L95">AppState</a> &#125;
</pre>

This helps to load Excalidraw with `initialData`. It must be an object or a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/Promise) which resolves to an object containing the below optional fields.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `elements` | [ExcalidrawElement[]](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/element/types.ts#L114) | The elements with which Excalidraw should be mounted. |
| `appState` | [AppState](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L95) | The App state with which Excalidraw should be mounted. |
| `scrollToContent` | boolean | This attribute implies whether to scroll to the nearest element to center once Excalidraw is mounted. By default, it will not scroll the nearest element to the center. Make sure you pass `initialData.appState.scrollX` and `initialData.appState.scrollY` when `scrollToContent` is false so that scroll positions are retained |
| `libraryItems` | [LibraryItems](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L200) &#124; Promise&lt;[LibraryItems](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L200)&gt; | This library items with which Excalidraw should be mounted. |
| `files` | [BinaryFiles](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L64) | The files added to the scene. |

You might want to use this when you want to load excalidraw with some initial elements and app state.

```jsx live
function ExcalidrawWithInitialData() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: "500px" }}>
      <Excalidraw
        initialData={{
          elements: [
            {
              type: "rectangle",
              version: 141,
              versionNonce: 361174001,
              isDeleted: false,
              id: "oDVXy8D6rom3H1-LLH2-f",
              fillStyle: "hachure",
              strokeWidth: 1,
              strokeStyle: "solid",
              roughness: 1,
              opacity: 100,
              angle: 0,
              x: 100.50390625,
              y: 93.67578125,
              strokeColor: "#000000",
              backgroundColor: "transparent",
              width: 186.47265625,
              height: 141.9765625,
              seed: 1968410350,
              groupIds: [],
            },
          ],
          appState: { zenModeEnabled: true, viewBackgroundColor: "#a5d8ff" },
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Storing custom data on Excalidraw elements

Beyond attributes that Excalidraw elements already support, you can store custom data on each element in a `customData` object. The type of the attribute is [`Record<string, any>`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/element/types.ts#L59) and is optional.

You can use this to add any extra information you need to keep track of.

You can add `customData` to elements when passing them as `initialData`, or using [`updateScene`](#updatescene)/[`updateLibrary`](#updatelibrary) afterwards.

```js showLineNumbers
{
  type: "rectangle",
  id: "oDVXy8D6rom3H1-LLH2-f",
  customData: {customId: '162'},
}
```




### isCollaborating

This prop indicates if the app is in collaboration mode.

### onPointerUpdate

This callback is triggered when mouse pointer is updated.

```js
({ x, y }, button, pointersMap}) => void;
```

1.`{x, y}`: Pointer coordinates

2.`button`: The position of the button. This will be one of `["down", "up"]`

3.`pointersMap`: [`pointers map`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L131) of the scene

```js
(exportedElements, appState, canvas) => void
```

1. `exportedElements`: An array of [non deleted elements](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/element/types.ts#L87) which needs to be exported.
2. `appState`: [AppState](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L95) of the scene.
3. `canvas`: The `HTMLCanvasElement` of the scene.

### langCode

Determines the language of the UI. It should be one of the [available language codes](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/i18n.ts#L14). Defaults to `en` (English). We also export default language and supported languages which you can import as shown below.

```js
import { defaultLang, languages } from "@excalidraw/excalidraw";
```

| name | type |
| --- | --- |
| defaultLang | string |
| languages | [Language[]](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/i18n.ts#L8) |

### renderTopRightUI

<pre>
(isMobile: boolean, appState: <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L95">AppState</a>) => JSX | null
</pre>

A function returning JSX to render custom UI in the top right corner of the app.

#### renderCustomStats

A function that can be used to render custom stats (returns JSX) in the nerd stats dialog. For example you can use this prop to render the size of the elements in the storage.

#### renderSidebar

```tsx
() => JSX | null;
```

Optional function that can render custom sidebar. This sidebar is the same that the library menu sidebar is using, and can be used for any purposes your app needs. The render function should return a `<Sidebar>` instance â€” a component that is exported from the Excalidraw package. It accepts `children` which can be any content you like to render inside.

The `<Sidebar>` component takes these props (all are optional except `children`):

| name | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| className | string |
| children | `tsxReact.ReactNode` | Content you want to render inside the sidebar. |
| onClose | `tsx() => void` | Invoked when the component is closed (by user, or the editor). No need to act on this event, as the editor manages the sidebar open state on its own. |
| onDock | `tsx(isDocked: boolean) => void` | Invoked when the user toggles the dock button. |
| docked | boolean | Indicates whether the sidebar is docked. By default, the sidebar is undocked. If passed, the docking becomes controlled, and you are responsible for updating the `docked` state by listening on `onDock` callback. See [here](#dockedsidebarbreakpoint) for more info docking. |
| dockable | boolean | Indicates whether the sidebar can be docked by user (=the dock button is shown). If `false`, you can still dock programmatically by passing `docked=true` |

The sidebar will always include a header with close/dock buttons (when applicable).

You can also add custom content to the header, by rendering `<Sidebar.Header>` as a child of the `<Sidebar>` component. Note that the custom header will still include the default buttons.

The `<Sidebar.Header>` component takes these props children (all are optional):

| name | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| className | string |
| children | `tsx React.ReactNode` | Content you want to render inside the sidebar header, sibling of the header buttons. |

For example code, see the example [`App.tsx`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/example/App.tsx#L524) file.

### viewModeEnabled

This prop indicates whether the app is in `view mode`. When supplied, the value takes precedence over `intialData.appState.viewModeEnabled`, the `view mode` will be fully controlled by the host app, and users won't be able to toggle it from within the app.

### zenModeEnabled

This prop indicates whether the app is in `zen mode`. When supplied, the value takes precedence over `intialData.appState.zenModeEnabled`, the `zen mode` will be fully controlled by the host app, and users won't be able to toggle it from within the app.

### gridModeEnabled

This prop indicates whether the shows the grid. When supplied, the value takes precedence over `intialData.appState.gridModeEnabled`, the grid will be fully controlled by the host app, and users won't be able to toggle it from within the app.

### libraryReturnUrl

If supplied, this URL will be used when user tries to install a library from [libraries.excalidraw.com](https://libraries.excalidraw.com). Defaults to `window.location.origin + window.location.pathname`. To install the libraries in the same tab from which it was opened, you need to set `window.name` (to any alphanumeric string) â€” if it's not set it will open in a new tab.

### theme

This prop controls Excalidraw's theme. When supplied, the value takes precedence over `intialData.appState.theme`, the theme will be fully controlled by the host app, and users won't be able to toggle it from within the app unless `UIOptions.canvasActions.toggleTheme` is set to `true`, in which case the `theme` prop will control Excalidraw's default theme with ability to allow theme switching (you must take care of updating the `theme` prop when you detect a change to `appState.theme` from the [onChange](#onchange) callback).

You can use [`THEME`](/docs/package/api/utils#theme) to specify the theme.

### name

This prop sets the name of the drawing which will be used when exporting the drawing. When supplied, the value takes precedence over `intialData.appState.name`, the `name` will be fully controlled by host app and the users won't be able to edit from within Excalidraw.

### UIOptions

This prop can be used to customise UI of Excalidraw. Currently we support customising [`canvasActions`](#canvasactions) and [`dockedSidebarBreakpoint`](#dockedsidebarbreakpoint). It accepts the below parameters

<pre>
&#123; canvasActions: <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L372">CanvasActions</a> }
</pre>

##### canvasActions

| Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `changeViewBackgroundColor` | boolean | true | Implies whether to show `Background color picker` |
| `clearCanvas` | boolean | true | Implies whether to show `Clear canvas button` |
| `export` | false &#124; [exportOpts](#exportopts) | `tsx{ saveFileToDisk: true }` | This prop allows to customize the UI inside the export dialog. By default it shows the "saveFileToDisk". If this prop is `false` the export button will not be rendered. For more details visit [`exportOpts`](#exportopts). |
| `loadScene` | boolean | true | Implies whether to show `Load button` |
| `saveToActiveFile` | boolean | true | Implies whether to show `Save button` to save to current file |
| `toggleTheme` | boolean &#124; null | `null` | Implies whether to show `Theme toggle`. When defined as `boolean`, takes precedence over [`props.theme`](#theme) to show `Theme toggle` |
| `saveAsImage` | boolean | true | Implies whether to show `Save as image button` |

##### dockedSidebarBreakpoint

This prop indicates at what point should we break to a docked, permanent sidebar. If not passed it defaults to [`MQ_RIGHT_SIDEBAR_MAX_WIDTH_PORTRAIT`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/constants.ts#L167). If the `width` of the `excalidraw` container exceeds `dockedSidebarBreakpoint`, the sidebar will be dockable. If user choses to dock the sidebar, it will push the right part of the UI towards the left, making space for the sidebar as shown below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11256141/174664866-c698c3fa-197b-43ff-956c-d79852c7b326.png)

### exportOpts

The below attributes can be set in `UIOptions.canvasActions.export` to customize the export dialog. If `UIOptions.canvasActions.export` is `false` the export button will not be rendered.

| Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `saveFileToDisk` | boolean | true | Implies if save file to disk button should be shown |
| `onExportToBackend` | `tsx (exportedElements: readonly NonDeletedExcalidrawElement[],appState: AppState,canvas: HTMLCanvasElement &#124; null) => void ` |  | This callback is triggered when the shareable-link button is clicked in the export dialog. The link button will only be shown if this callback is passed. |
| `renderCustomUI` | `tsx (exportedElements: readonly NonDeletedExcalidrawElement[],appState: AppState,canvas: HTMLCanvasElement &#124; null) => void ` |  | This callback should be supplied if you want to render custom UI in the export dialog. |

### onPaste

This callback is triggered if passed when something is pasted into the scene. You can use this callback in case you want to do something additional when the paste event occurs.

<pre>
(data: <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/clipboard.ts#L18">ClipboardData</a>, event: ClipboardEvent &#124; null) => boolean
</pre>

This callback must return a `boolean` value or a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/Promise) which resolves to a boolean value.

In case you want to prevent the excalidraw paste action you must return `false`, it will stop the native excalidraw clipboard management flow (nothing will be pasted into the scene).


### detectScroll

Indicates whether Excalidraw should listen for `scroll` event on the nearest scrollable container in the DOM tree and recompute the coordinates (e.g. to correctly handle the cursor) when the component's position changes. You can disable this when you either know this doesn't affect your app or you want to take care of it yourself (calling the [`refresh()`](#ref) method).

### handleKeyboardGlobally

Indicates whether to bind keyboard events to `document`. Disabled by default, meaning the keyboard events are bound to the Excalidraw component. This allows for multiple Excalidraw components to live on the same page, and ensures that Excalidraw keyboard handling doesn't collide with your app's (or the browser) when the component isn't focused.

Enable this if you want Excalidraw to handle keyboard even if the component isn't focused (e.g. a user is interacting with the navbar, sidebar, or similar).

### onLibraryChange

This callback if supplied will get triggered when the library is updated and has the below signature.

<pre>
  (items:{" "}
  <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L200">
    LibraryItems
  </a>
  ) => void | Promise&lt;any&gt;
</pre>

It is invoked with empty items when user clears the library. You can use this callback when you want to do something additional when library is updated for example persisting it to local storage.



### autoFocus

This prop implies whether to focus the Excalidraw component on page load. Defaults to false.

### generateIdForFile

Allows you to override `id` generation for files added on canvas (images). By default, an SHA-1 digest of the file is used.

```
(file: File) => string | Promise<string>
```

### onLinkOpen

This prop if passed will be triggered when clicked on link. To handle the redirect yourself (such as when using your own router for internal links), you must call `event.preventDefault()`.

```tsx
(element: ExcalidrawElement, 
 event: CustomEvent<{ nativeEvent: MouseEvent }>) => void
```

Example:

```ts
const history = useHistory();

// open internal links using the app's router, but opens external links in
// a new tab/window
const onLinkOpen: ExcalidrawProps["onLinkOpen"] = useCallback(
  (element, event) => {
    const link = element.link;
    const { nativeEvent } = event.detail;
    const isNewTab = nativeEvent.ctrlKey || nativeEvent.metaKey;
    const isNewWindow = nativeEvent.shiftKey;
    const isInternalLink =
      link.startsWith("/") || link.includes(window.location.origin);
    if (isInternalLink && !isNewTab && !isNewWindow) {
      history.push(link.replace(window.location.origin, ""));
      // signal that we're handling the redirect ourselves
      event.preventDefault();
    }
  },
  [history],
);
```

### onPointerDown

This prop if passed will be triggered on pointer down events and has the below signature.

<pre>
(activeTool: <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L115"> AppState["activeTool"]</a>, pointerDownState: <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L424">PointerDownState</a>) => void
</pre>

### onScrollChange

This prop if passed will be triggered when canvas is scrolled and has the below signature.

```ts
(scrollX: number, scrollY: number) => void
```
