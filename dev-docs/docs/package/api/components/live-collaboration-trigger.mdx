# LiveCollaborationTrigger

If you implement live collaboration support and want to expose the same UI button as on [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com), you can render the `<LiveCollaborationTrigger/>` component using the [renderTopRightUI](/docs/package/api/props#rendertoprightui) prop.

You'll need to supply `onSelect()` to handle opening of your collaboration dialog, but the button will display current `appState.collaborators` count for you.

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `onSelect` | `() => any` | Yes |  | Handler called when the user click on the button |
| `isCollaborating` | `boolean` | Yes | false | Whether live collaboration session is in effect. Modifies button style. |

```jsx live
function ExcalidrawWithLiveCollaborationTrigger() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: "500px" }}>
      <Excalidraw
        renderTopRightUI={() => (
          <LiveCollaborationTrigger
            onSelect={() => {
              window.alert("You clicked on collab button");
              setIsCollaborating(true)
            }}
          />
        )}
      ></Excalidraw>
    </div>
  );
}
```
