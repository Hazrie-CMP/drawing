Excalidraw is a collaborative online whiteboard tool primarily designed for creating hand-drawn diagrams and illustrations. When you download your Excalidraw canvas as a PNG, SVG, or image file, it should ideally include all the elements present on your canvas, including any frames or boundaries you have drawn.

If you're facing issues where frames are not displayed in the downloaded image, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Your Browser**: Ensure you are using a modern and up-to-date web browser. Excalidraw is web-based, so the browser you use can affect its functionality. Try using a different browser if you encounter issues.

2. **Zoom Level**: Sometimes, the zoom level of your canvas can affect the visibility of certain elements. Make sure you are zoomed in or out to a level where the frames are visible on the canvas before downloading.

3. **Clear Cache**: Clear your browser's cache and cookies, as cached data can sometimes cause display issues.

4. **Browser Extensions**: Disable any browser extensions or add-ons that might be interfering with Excalidraw's functionality.

5. **Export Options**: When exporting, check the export options/settings. Ensure that you have selected the appropriate export format (PNG, SVG, etc.), and that you have not inadvertently excluded frames from the export.

6. **Update Excalidraw**: Make sure you are using the latest version of Excalidraw. Developers regularly release updates that may fix bugs and improve functionality.

7. **Report a Bug**: If the issue persists, consider reporting it as a bug to the Excalidraw development team. They may be able to provide specific guidance or address the problem in future updates.
